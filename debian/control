Description: tool for configuring and maintaining network machines
 Cfengine is a suite of programs for integrated autonomic management of either
 individual or networked computers
 .
 Cfengine 3 is both a more powerful and much simplified version of cfengine, 
 which has been designed to interoperate with cfengine 2 rather than be backwards 
 compatible with it
 .
 With cfengine 3 you can install, configure and maintain computers using powerful
 hands-free tools.
